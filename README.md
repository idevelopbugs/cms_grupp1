# Group 1 Simple CMS, PHP/MYSQL, FEND 16
By Harris, Liam, Janaina

## What does this CMS do ?
We wanted to create a simple blog which allows new users to sign up, create blogposts and give feedback to other users posts by "liking" it. It is written in mainly in PHP using Classmethods for Posts and Users. 

### Userside
- Users can signup and login
- Write, Delete and Edit their own post
- Like/Unlike other posts by other users
### Adminside
- Admin has same base privilage as an user
- Can also remove any post on the blog

### Future improvements to consider
- Use more AJAX-requests to handle the login, create/edit posts
- Make an admindashboard with more options
- Make a profilepage for users
- Improve design

### Tools used in this project
- Bootstrap
- Jquery, Ajax
